# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the MediClear app logo with the newly uploaded "ab" letterform logo.

**Planned changes:**
- Save the new logo as a static asset at `frontend/public/assets/generated/app-logo.png`
- Update `AppHeader.tsx` to use the new logo image
- Update `SplashScreen.tsx` to use the new logo image
- Remove all references to the old logo

**User-visible outcome:** The new dark-background "ab" letterform logo with deep red and charcoal styling appears in the app header and on the splash screen.
